# CDL - Ledger Evolution View

The Ledger Evolution view shows a sequence of ledger transactions involving the Primary States which conform to the constraints defined in the Smart Contract. You can think of this view as a way of seeing a Smart Contract *in action*. You can use it to bring a Smart Contract to life by telling a story about how it might be used.

For example, a Ledger Evolution diagram for your agreement example Smart Contract might look like this:
