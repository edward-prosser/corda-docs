# CorDapp Design Language (CDL)

Welcome to the CorDapp Design Language (CDL) Documentation. Use this guide to discover what CDL is, and how it can help you effectively document, analyse, and communicate your [CorDapp](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/cordapp-overview.html) designs.

As Corda transactions can represent high-value business activity, where mistakes can cost material amounts of money, a way to structure and organise your design becomes increasingly important. The CDL exists to give you confidence that all design eventualities had been considered as you create your CorDapps.

From here you can:

* Get started with an [overview of the CDL](cdl-overview).
* Explore [the CDL views](cdl-views).
* See how to move from [CDL to code](cdl-to-code/cdl-to-code.md).
